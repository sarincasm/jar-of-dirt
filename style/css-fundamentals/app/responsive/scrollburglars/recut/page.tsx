							Reduce Your Video Transcription Bill
						</h1>

						<p>
							Got some audio or video to transcribe? Maybe you already
							use a service like Otter.ai or Descript to automatically
							transcribe your videos.
						</p>
						<p>
							The trouble with transcription services is they usually
							charge you based on the length of the recording â€“ including
							the silent parts!
						</p>
						<p>
							If you were gonna cut out that silence anyway, it seems a
							bit of a waste!
						</p>
						<p>
							You can save on transcription time (and save some money!)
							by removing the silence before you transcribe.
						</p>
						<p>
							Doing this manually is a pain though. It looks something
							like:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Open the video in your editor â€“ Final Cut, Premiere,
								Resolve, ScreenFlow, etc.
							</li>
							<li>Select each chunk of silence.</li>
							<li>Ripple delete it.</li>
							<li>Rinse and repeat, maybe hundreds of times.</li>
							<li>Export the video.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							That&apos;ll probably take hours though, and your time is
							worth more than that!
						</p>
						<h2>Remove Silence from Videos Automatically</h2>
						<p>
							Instead, you can pass it through this little app called
							<a href="https://getrecut.com/">Recut</a>.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Drag your video or audio into Recut.</li>
							<li>Recut automatically finds the silence.</li>
							<li>
								Export a new video/audio file, with the silence
								automatically removed.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Then take that shorter video and upload it for
							transcription ðŸ˜Ž
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								I have a bunch of random voice notes from iOS voice
								memos and they have a lot of silence in them because
								I&apos;ve just let it run.
							</p>
							<p>
								With Recut I could quickly throw those in and trim the
								audio, and that way the silence isnâ€™t eating into the
								transcription time on Descript.
							</p>

							Recut is a Mac app that automatically finds and removes
							silence from your videos. Check out this quick demo:
						</p>
						<iframe
							className="mt-8 w-full max-w-xl sm:h-64 md:h-[350px] mx-auto"
							src="./assets/525952080.html"
							allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
						></iframe>
						<p>
							In addition to exporting video/audio directly, Recut can
							also export the <strong>cut list</strong>.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is awesome if you normally edit in something like
							ScreenFlow, Final Cut, Premiere, or DaVinci Resolve.
						</p>
						<p>
							Import the premade timeline of cuts, with the silence
							already removed, apply your final edits, and you&apos;re
							all done.
