# Feathers BFF

A quick and dirty BFF for the [feathers app](../).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run initialization script

```bash
npm run init
```

This will generate some "static" data that the app needs on initial launch. This data can be refreshed by running the script again.

3. Start the server

```bash
npm start
```
